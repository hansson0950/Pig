# Pig (Dice Game) with Unittests

## Description
This Python project is an implementation of the classic game of Pig, a simple dice game where two players take turns rolling a die, with the goal of being the first player to reach a certain score threshold. In this implementation, the score threshold is set to 100.

## Installation
You can download the project files from the GitHub repository at https://github.com/hansson0950/Pig. Once downloaded, you can navigate to the project directory and run the game using the following command: <application/game.py>.

## Unittests
This project also includes a suite of unittests to test the various functions of the game. To run the unittests, navigate to the project directory and run the following command: <python -m unittest discover -s unit_tests>.

This will run all of the unittests in the tests directory and report the results. The unittests cover the following modules:
- game.py: This class starts the program and handles all the necessary logic and method calls.
- player.py: Creates an object of a player and handles most available moves a player can make inside the game.
- computer.py: Inherits the player class, has its own logic for when to roll or hold.
- dice.py: Responsible for the dice rolls.
- high_score.py: Handles all high scores by reading and writing to the file called high_scores.txt.
- ui.py: Manages almost, if not all, prints to the terminal.

## Documentation
It is possible to generate documentation from the code and the python docstrings. To do this, navigate to the folder that contains the classes you would like to create documentation for. Then, use the command <python -m pdoc3 --html <class_name.py>> to generate documentation as HTML.

It is also possible to generate UML diagrams for the classes as well as the packages. To do this, navigate to the folder that contains the classes you would like to create UML diagrams for. Then, use the command <pyreverse dice.py> and then <dot -Tpng classes.dot -o classes.png> to get a .png file. You can do the same for the packages with the command <dot -Tpng packages.dot -o packages.png>.

Note: This requires installation of some necessary softwares such as chocolatey and graphviz.
